# Autonomous Vehicle Computer Vision System

## Introduction

This project, developed in November 2021, focuses on the implementation of a computer vision system for an autonomous vehicle. The vision system leverages OpenCV for advanced image processing techniques and employs the MQTT communication protocol. The project was undertaken for educational purposes, aiming to enhance understanding and skills in the fields of computer vision and autonomous vehicle technology.

## Project Overview

The Autonomous Vehicle Computer Vision System project was part of the Challenge Autonomous Vehicle, powered by FIAP and NVIDIA in November 2021. The project achieved recognition as the winning solution in the challenge, acknowledged by FIAP and NVIDIA for its innovation and promising contributions to the future of urban mobility.

## Implementation Details

- **Computer Vision Techniques:** The project utilized OpenCV for designing and implementing advanced computer vision techniques. This included tasks such as image processing, object detection, and lane detection.

- **Communication Protocol:** The MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol was employed for efficient communication between the computer vision modules and the vehicle's control and navigation systems.

## How to Use This Repository

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python:**
   - Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.

2. **Install Virtual Environment:**
   - Install a virtual environment library:
     - On Windows: `py -m pip install --user virtualenv`
     - On Linux/MacOS: `python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv`

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - In the repository folder:
     - On Windows: `py -m venv env`
     - On Linux/MacOS: `python3 -m venv env`

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows: `.\env\Scripts\activate`
   - On Linux/MacOS: `source .env/bin/activate`

5. **Install Requirements:**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.

6. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the program by running `python vision.py`.
